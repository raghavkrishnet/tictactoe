# Tic-Tac-Toe
**Tic-tac-toe** (American English), **noughts and crosses** (Commonwealth English), or **Xs and Os** (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with ***X or O***. 
<br>
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.<br> It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
